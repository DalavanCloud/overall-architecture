## Executive Summary

The 4th and last "expectation of behaviour" specified by Tim Berners-Lee in his proposal to create a web of data was
to "include links to other URIs so that they can discover more things". A particular class of these links are those that
connect different representations of the same thing. Being able to connect records coming from different data sources is
a fundamental objective of any data integration effort starting from putting together records of in different spreadsheets to integrating data assets owned by one or more companies and finally merging different views of a subject in the World Wide Web where the AAA slogan must apply: "Anyone can say Anything about Any topic".

The objective of the task has been to provide a support for disambiguating and interlinking entities that are added to a LDP container.

## Background
(Why was this task created, what is the goal of the subtask and how does it contribute to the deliverable )

This task has been proposed to offer a mechaism to a user of the platform to discover entities that have been given different names by different authors that refer to the same thing in order to merge their descriptions and augment the knowledge about the entity. This is a crucial task for any user of the platform since what she likely wants is not a container as a collection of disconnetted graphs but a well connected knowledge base. The task of disambiguating entities has been given different name by different communities: record linkage, deduplication, entity resolution. All the methodologies that have been developed to
discover equivalent entities are based on the assumption of the identity of indiscernibles [2] that is attributed to the German philosopher Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, that states that there cannot be separate objects that have all their properties exactly the same.

Two ways of finding equivalent entities
- inference based on functional and inverse functional properties
- comparing the properties of the entities



- The owl:sameAs relation: simmetry, reflexivity, transitivity



- Meaning of the property owl:sameAs
Given two entities A and B in a RDF graph that are found to be the same, for each triple in which A is subject or object a new triple is added with B in place of A.



- Properties used to disambiguate persons, organizations, places.



- Alignment of the properties used to describe the entities

UC 1) A user wants to discover duplicates in a RDF data set
UC 2) A user wants to interlink entities, like persons, organizations or places, in a container to entities in a public data set

## Execution/Implementation
(Describe the strategy to implement the task, describe how the risk known upfront were taken into account, describe the actual implementation, describe all trial and error, discussions, failures etc.)

1) Implement  proprietary solution
2) Choose a tool that provides common algorithms and can be extended
3) Any solution must fit in the platform architecture

## Solution
(Describe the solution in detail, start with the benefit the solution provides, then go to the technical details.)

- Implementation of the transformer (based on the REST architecture)
- Description of the tool (SILK)
- Description of the transformer

## Future work
(Briefly outline how this solution or the way to implement it could be improved by others.)
