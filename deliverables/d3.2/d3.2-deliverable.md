## Executive Summary

The 4th and last "expectation of behaviour" specified by Tim Berners-Lee in his proposal to create a web of data was
to "include links to other URIs so that they can discover more things". A particular class of these links are those that
connect different representations of the same thing. Being able to connect records coming from different data sources is
a fundamental objective of any data integration effort starting from putting together records of in different spreadsheets to integrating data assets owned by one or more companies and finally merging different views of a subject in the World Wide Web where the AAA slogan must apply: "Anyone can say Anything about Any topic".

The objective of the task has been to provide a support for disambiguating and interlinking entities that are added to a LDP container.

## Background
(Why was this task created, what is the goal of the subtask and how does it contribute to the deliverable )

This task has been proposed to offer a mechanism to a user of the platform to discover entities that have been given different names by different authors that refer to the same thing in order to merge their descriptions and augment the knowledge about the entity. This is a crucial task for any user of the platform since what she likely wants is not a collection of disconnected graphs but a well connected knowledge base. The task of disambiguating entities has been given different name by different communities: record linkage, deduplication, entity resolution and so forth. All the methodologies that have been developed to discover equivalent entities are based on the assumption of the identity of indiscernibles [2] that is attributed to the German philosopher Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, that states that there cannot be separate objects that have all their properties exactly the same. In order to ascertain whether two entities are the same two types of inferences can be evaluated. On one hand an identity can be inferred from functional and inverse functional properties when there are some statements that relates two entities and the properties are of the type mentioned. As an example, if the following facts are stated

:Bob :hasFather :John  
:Bob :hasFather :Johnny  

and we know that  

:hasFather rdf:type owl:FunctionalProperty  

the identity :John owl:sameAs :Johnny can be inferred by a reasoner. The problem is that it doesn't happen very often that an entity in a data set is related to an entity in a different data set through a functional property. Inverse functional properties like passport number, driver license fiscal codes, are used more frequently. As an example, if the following facts are stated

:John :hasPassport "A123456"  
:Johnny :hasPassport "A123456"

and we know that

:hasPassport rdf:type owl:InverseFunctionalProperty

then a reasoner can infer :John owl:sameAs :Johnny. That said, such properties are not always available and it can happen that the values contain errors so that it is always better to decide about the identity of two entities on more than one single property. In order to disambiguate two entities by their description, i.e. comparing their properties, we must analyze the following information

* the vocabulary used for the description  
* whether the properties are enough to distinguish two entities globally  
* spelling errors and differences in writing literal values

Starting with the case in which all the entities are described using the same vocabulary, so that there is no ambiguity in the meaning of the properties, we have to decide which properties must be compared in order to distinguish two entities globally in the Semantic Web and Linked Data world. In the relational database world this decision is similar to the definition of primary key for a tuple. The type of the entities are usually available or can be easily inferred. For entities like persons properties like name, place and date of birth can considered enough in most cases, for entities like organization the same is for the name, the registered office or its address. In case this or other properties are missing we will have to report the uncertainty in a threshold value that must be calculated as a result of the comparison of all the properties used.

* In order to unambiguously identify an entity a certain set of semantically equivalent properties must be chosen.  
* Properties used to disambiguate persons, organizations, places.  

* The owl:sameAs relation: simmetry, reflexivity, transitivity  


Meaning of the property owl:sameAs:  
if two entities A and B are believed to be the same then, for substitution axiom, every sentence that is true of A must be true of B. Translated in RDF this principle entails that for each triple in which A is subject or object a new triple can be inferred by a reasoner with B in place of A and viceversa. The issue with the given semantics of the owl:sameAs property is that there might be good reasons (see [4]) to not believe all the claims about the individual A made by an external data provider and at the same time we are not assured our claims are shared by the external data provider if those claims were not already in the data set. The decision in the first case could depend on the provenance of the data set.  

Alignment of the properties used to describe the entities.  

Linkage rules, similarity measures (distance metrics), thresholds  

UC 1) A user wants to discover duplicates in a RDF data set  
UC 2) A user wants to interlink entities, like persons, organizations or places, in a container to entities in a public data  set

## Execution/Implementation
(Describe the strategy to implement the task, describe how the risk known upfront were taken into account, describe the actual implementation, describe all trial and error, discussions, failures etc.)

* Implement  proprietary solution  
* Choose a tool that provides common algorithms and metrics, configurable and allows extensions

* issue with blocking  
* SILK selected as it comes with Apache 2.0 license.  
* Issues with geographical data: differnt formats, ShapeFile, CSV, JSON, XML
* Issues with geographical data: coordinates in different reference system (WGS84, UTM)
* Issues with geographical data: Incosistent use of vocabularies
* Issues with geographical data: geocoding of addresses


## Solution
(Describe the solution in detail, start with the benefit the solution provides, then go to the technical details.)

* Implementation of the transformer (based on the REST architecture)
