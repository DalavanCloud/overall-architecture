## Motivation

[Open Annotation](http://www.openannotation.org/spec/core/) specifies an interoperable 
framework for creating associations between related resources, annotations, using a 
methodology that conforms to the Architecture of the World Wide Web. 

[FISE](http://stanbol.apache.org/docs/trunk/components/enhancer/enhancementstructure)
is the current enhancement structure used by [Stanbol](http://stanbol.apache.org). An
ontology defining all custom concepts and properties required for producing annotations.

Since Stanbol is currently [working in the 1.0 release](http://markmail.org/message/6dwwkwv7elmo6454),
it is the right time to address some major changes that will break backward compatibility. 
An the annotation model is one of the candidates. The project would be happy to get
contributions from Fusepool on such aspect.

This document is part of the outcomes of DSS23 from the [backlog](https://easybacklog.com/accounts/4748/backlogs/54217).
