# Fusepool P3: Stanbol's FISE alignment with Open Annotation

## Motivation

Since Stanbol is currently [working in the 1.0 release](http://markmail.org/message/6dwwkwv7elmo6454),
now it is the right time to address some major changes that will break backward compatibility. 
An the annotation model is one of the obvious candidates. The project would be happy to get
contributions from Fusepool on such aspect.

[Stanbol](http://stanbol.apache.org) currently uses 
[FISE](http://stanbol.apache.org/docs/trunk/components/enhancer/enhancementstructure),
a custom ontology defining all required concepts and properties for producing annotations
from content.

[Open Annotation](http://www.openannotation.org/spec/core/) specifies an interoperable 
framework for creating associations between related resources, annotations, using a 
methodology that conforms to the Architecture of the World Wide Web. Another potential
candidate could be [NIF](http://persistence.uni-leipzig.org/nlp2rdf/), a format that 
aims to achieve interoperability between NLP tools. And other candidates could be taken 
into account too.

This document is part of the outcomes of DSS23 from the [backlog](https://easybacklog.com/accounts/4748/backlogs/54217).

# Introduction

## NIF, OLiA and NERD

[NIF](http://nlp2rdf.org/nif-1-0) (Nlp Interchange Format, [paper](http://svn.aksw.org/papers/2013/ISWC_NIF/public.pdf)) is an RDF based format that aims to achieve interoperability between Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools, language resources and annotations. To formally represent NLP annotations NIF first defines an URI scheme based on [RFC 5147](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5147) that allows to reference Strings (words, phrases, sentences ...) as RDF resources and second it defines/uses a set OWL ontology that allows to formally describe such Strings.
The String Ontology is the core vocabulary to describe a String as part of a document and possible a sub-String of an other one. Structured Sentence Ontology (SSO) allows to define Strings as Sentences, Phrases or Words and its relationships.

The Ontologies of Linguistic Annotation ([OLiA](http://purl.org/olia) - [paper](http://www.semantic-web-journal.net/system/files/swj518.pdf)) defines a Reference Model with classes for linguistic categories (e.g. Noun, Determiner ...). Multiple Annotation Models formalize annotation schemes and tag sets used by different corpora and languages. Finally for every Annotation Model there is also a Linking Model that aligns it with the OLiA Reference Model. This allows to use the OLiA Reference Model to access/query NLP annotations using different annotation models (e.g. NLP annotations generated by different NLP tools/framework). It also supports queries for Words with a specific lexical category (e.g. ProperNouns) in texts with different languages. NIF uses OLiA for representing the POS annotations of words.

[NERD](http://nerd.eurecom.fr/ontology/) (Named Entity Recognition and Disambiguation - papers: [1](http://nerd.eurecom.fr/ui/paper/Rizzo_Troncy-eacl2012demo.pdf), [2](http://events.linkeddata.org/ldow2012/papers/ldow2012-paper-02.pdf)) defines both a data model for describing detected Named Entities as well as an ontology for the types of Named Entities. This hierarchy of Named Entity types is also aligned with several other ontologies and common datasets. NIF uses NER to link Strings with entities as well as with the NER type.
