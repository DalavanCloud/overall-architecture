# Fusepool P3 Annotation Model

The Fusepool P3 Annotation Model is used by all Annotator implementations of the Fusepool Plattform. Annotators and transformers together build the components of the Transformation API.

Defining a commonly used model is core of enabling the use and configuration of Annotations workflows - piping different annotators together. It is also important for the consumption of annotation results.

## Usage

The Fusepool P3 Annotation Model is still being defined. All terms will be under the following normative namespace:

    http://vocab.fusepool.info/fam#

Behind that namespece there is not yet a proper RDF vocabulary/ontology defined. But it will be added in the upcoming weeks.

## Design Considerations

After the evaluation of different Annotation Standards it was decided to define the Fusepool Annotation Model based on the [Open Annotation](http://www.openannotation.org/spec/core/) standard. As Apache Stanbol will contribute most of the Annotator implementations it was however also important to ensure that annotations created by Apache Stanbol con be transformed to the Fusepool Annotation Model. That means that the information provided by the [Stanbol Enhancement Structure](http://stanbol.apache.org/docs/trunk/components/enhancer/enhancementstructure) are sufficient to create Fusepool Annotations.

### Expressiveness vs. ease of use 

Open Annotation defines is a very expressive model. While this allows to formulate very complex annotations it also comes with the disadvantage that one needs to follow a lot of indirections for extracting simple things. A good example is getting the selection for an annotation as this requires to traverse over 4 relations and 5 resources. The following listing shows the required relations and resources.

    (1) {annotation-body} <--oa:hasBody-- {annotation}
    (2) {annotation} --oa:hasTarget--> {specific-resource}
    (3) {specific-resource} --oa:hasSource--> {content}
    (4) {specific-resource} --oa:hasSelector--> {selector}
    (5) {selector} definitions
    
The Stanbol Enhancement Structure has a simpler model where annotation and selectors are merged to the same resource (a `fise:TextAnnotation`). Because of that the above request can be answered only by using the Text Annotation resource.

As a tradeoff between both the Fusepool Annotation Structure will define some shortcut relations between `{annotation-body}` and `{content}` as well as the `{selector}`. 

### Transformation from Stanbol Enhancement Structure

The design of the Fusepool Annotation Model must ensure that a transformation from the [Stanbol Enhancement Structure](http://stanbol.apache.org/docs/trunk/components/enhancer/enhancementstructure) is possible. This ensures that all Enhancement Engines available for Apache Stanbol can be used as transformers in the Fusepool Plattform.


## Annotation Model

This section describes the Annotation Model as used by Fusepool. This annotation model is build upon a core that is fully compatible to Open Annotation. On top of this core Fusepool defines multiple _Annotation Types_ used as `{annotation-body}`. _Annotation Types_ are extensible meaning that transformers capable of extracting information not covered by the _Annotation Types_ defined in this specification can define/use their own _Annotation Types_.

This chapter first provides the definition of the Annotation code followed by the definition of the different Annotation Types in their own sub-sections.

### Annotation Core

The core of the Fusepool Annotation Model is build upon [Open Annotation](http://www.openannotation.org/spec/core/). The following figure shows the Open Annotation annotation model including two additional relations as defined by the Fusepool Annotation Model.

![Fusepool Annotation Model](fp-anno-model.png)

As shown by the above figure each Fusepool Annotation has the following elements

* an `{annotation}` resource with the `rdf:type` `oa:Annotation`. This resource also holds all metadata about the annotation process including the provenance information.
* an `{annotation-body}` representing the actual annotation. Different annotation bodies are defined for different types of annotations (e.g. detected language, Named Entities, Linked Entities, Categorizations and Topics). This is also an extension point meaning that special Exractors can define their own annotation types.
* Fusepool always uses a `{sptarget}` - an resource with the `rdf:type` `oa:SpecificResource` as target of annotation. This `{sptarget}` resource is to represent the n-ary relation to the `{content}` ( `source` in Open Annotation terms) and the `{selector}`. For textual resources Fusepool uses a combination of the `oa:TextPositionSelector` and the `oa:TextQuoteSelector`. That means that the selector will both provide the start/end char offsets as well as the prefix, exact and suffix information.

To make the consumption of the annotations easier the Fusepool Annotation Model defines the following two relations:

1. `fam:selector` defines a direct relation between the `{annotation-body}` and the `{selector}`. This property is used as shortcut for the following path in the  Open Annotation model: `{annotation-body} <--oa:hasBody-- {annotation} --oa:hasTarget--> {sptarget} --oa:hasSelector--> {selector}` 
2. `fam:extracted-from` defines a direct relation between the `{annotation-body}` and the `{content}`. This property is used as shortcut for the following path in the  Open Annotation model: `{annotation-body} <--oa:hasBody-- {annotation} --oa:hasTarget--> {sptarget} --oa:hasSource--> {content}`

Finally the core annotation modules also defines `fam:confidence` a property commonly used by all _Annotation Types_ defined in the following sections.
Values of this property are expected to be floating point values in the range [0 .. 1] where `0` represents the lowest confidence and `1` the highest. However values MUST BE interpreted as [Rational Scale](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_scale#Ordinal_scale) meaning that only =, â‰ , > and < operations may be done on confidence values. This also means that assertion such as an Annotation with an confidence of `0.8` are twice as likely to be correct as one with `0.4` are not possible.  

### Language Annotation

A Language Annotation is used to annotate the language of the parsed content or even the language of an part of the parsed content. The Stanbol Enhancement Structure uses a `fise:TextAnnotation` with the `dct:type` value `dct:LinguisticSystem` for this purpose. The detected language is provided as value of the `dct:language` property. As a `fise:TextAnnotation` is used it is also possible to define a sub-section within the processed document the language was detected for. 

In Fusepool Annotations that describe the language of the processed content are marked by the `fam:LanguageAnnotation` type. This annotation uses the `dct:language` property to provide the detected language.

The following figure shows an Language Annotation for English and an confidence of `0.997`

![Language Annotation](fp-anno-language.png)

In the case that multiple language annotations are present for the same section in the text an `oa:Choice` can be used to formally represent the different options.

### Text Annotation

_Text Annotation_ are used to annotate Entity Mentions in the text. Such annotations can originate from different transformer types:

1. Named Entity Recognition (NER): NER is an Natural Language Processing (NLP) technique that detects the mentions of Named Entities of a given Types in texts. Both statistical and rule based systems are possible. NER extractors are usually trained for specific types of entities. Typically they do support Persons, Organizations and Locations but also other types such as Roles, Money, Date/Time ... are common.
2. Entity Mention: In this case an transformer uses some kind of controlled vocabulary (e.g. the list of employees, projects) as a basis to detect mentions of such entities in parsed text.

In both cases tansformers will create a _Text Annotation_ to formally describe the extracted information. Apache Stanbol uses `fise:TextAnnotation` for that purpose. The Fusepool `fam:TextAnnotation` is very similar

* `fam:entity-type`: the general type of the detected entity. Transformers are free to use any type. However it is recommended to use types form well known ontologies such as [NERD](http://nerd.eurecom.fr/ontology), [DBPedia](http://mappings.dbpedia.org/server/ontology/classes/), [Schema.org](http://schema.org/docs/full.html) or similar.
* `fam:entity-mention`: The lexical form of the mention in the text. This is not necessarily the exact literal of the selected section in the text but is expected to represent the mentioned name of the Entity. Examples for deviations from the mention with the selection are due to lemmatization, case corrections, ...

The following figure shows an example of a _Text Annotation_ for Salzburg detected as Named Entity with the type dbpedia Place in the sentence "Mozard was born in Salzburg"

![Text Annotation](fp-anno-text.png) 

The _Text Annotation_ provides direct relations to all information required for typical use cases. Most important the mention `Salzburg` and the type `dbp:Place` of the Named Entity. Also the content and the selector are directly linked. The full annotation structure as defined by Open Annotation is also available and shown by the dotted elements in the figure.

### Entity Annotation

_Entity Annotation_ are used to link/suggest Entities from some controlled vocabulary for mentions - annotated as _Text Annotation_ in analysed text. _Entity Annotation_ are typically created by Entity Linking Extractros. Those are Extractors that are configured with some form of a controlled vocabulary and can link them with _Named Entities_ already detected by some NER Extractor or by directly looking for Entities by matching their labels with the Words in the text.

The following figure shows the base model of `fam:EntityAnnotation`

![Entity Annotation](fp-anno-entity.png)

_Entity Annotation_ define two specific properties. The `fam:entity-label` is expected to provide the label of the linked entity. The language should match the language detected for the document. It is NOT recommended for extractors to add additional information about the Entity to the _Entity Annotation_. The preferred way to provide additional information about linked Entities is to add them directly to the URI of the Entity - or in other words - to dereference (parts) of the Entity information.

It is also possible to combine a _Text Annotation_ with an _Entity Annotation_. A typical scenarion of this is when there is only a single matching Entity for an _Named Entity_ in the text. The following figure gives such an example:

![Text and Entity Annotation](fp-anno-text-entity.png)

The above figure shows a single `{annotation-body}` typed both as `fam:TextAnnotation` and `fam:EntityAnnotation`. Properties of both Annotation types are used to describe the Entity. In the shown example the `fam:entity-mention` and `fam:entity-label` do have the same value. However those values might be different (e.g. if the text mentions "1st Lieutenant" but the label of the Entity is "First lieutenant").

Case where multiple Entities are possible matches for a _Named Entity_ are described by using the Open Annotation `oa:Choice` concept. In such cases the `{annotation-bofy}` describing the _Named Entity_ is typed as both `fam:TextAnnotation` and `oa:Choice`. All suggested Entities are represented as `fam:EntityAnnotation` and linked by using the `oa:item` relation. The following figure shows an example where the _Entities_ for the "City of Salzburg" and "Salzburg State" are suggested for the _Named Entity_ "Salzburg" in the text. 

![Multiple Suggested Entities](fp-anno-multiple-suggestions.png)

Note that both suggestions do have different `fam:confidence` values. Users are expected to use those to sort the multiple suggestions.

### Topic Annotation

_Topic Annotations_ are used to assign categories to a content - or part of the content. _Topic Annotation_ behave differently as _Entity Annotation_ . First assigned categories might not be directly mentioned in the analysed text and second multiple assigned categories do not exclude each others - meaning that a Users is not expected to select a single category as this is the case with multiple _Entity Annotation_ suggested for the same _Text Annotation_.

For the annotation of a topic classification two annotation types are defined. The `fam:TopicClassification` is used to define the classification based on a classification scheme as a `oa:Sequence`. Single classifications based on topics of the used scheme are modelled as `fam:TopicAnnotation` instances. The following figure shows this model based on an example where a text is classified by two topics contained in the same classification scheme.

![Topic Classification and Topic Annotations](fp-anno-topic.png)

The `fam:TopicClassification` is defined as `rdfs:subClassOf` `oa:Sequence`. Even so it is recommended to explicitly add both types as clients are not expected to support RDFS reasoning. The _Topic Classification_ concept only defines a single property `fam:classifcation-scheme` that can be used to explicitly define the scheme used for the classification. It is recommended to use [SKOS](http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/) to define classification scheme. If SKOS is used the `fam:classifcation-scheme` is expected to link the the `skos:ConceptScheme` instance. In case a _Topic Classification_ does use multiple schemes multiple `fam:classifcation-scheme` will be present.

For the annotation of extracted topics `fam:TopicAnnotation` are used. The `fam:topic-reference` is used to link to the URI of the topic (in case of SKOS a `skos:Concept` instance). The `fam:topic-label` holds the label of the topic. In case extracted topics are just defined by strings (and not formally defined as concepts) _Topic Annotation_ will just define the `fam:topic-label` property.

Additional information about linked _Topics_ should not be added to the _Topic Annotation_. If such information are desired they should be directly added to the URI of the linked _Topic_ - or in other words - used parts of the Thesaurie shall be dereferenced to the RDF graph with the annotations.


## Transformation of FISE to the Fusepool Annotation Model

This section describes transformation instructions for the [FISE enhancement Structure]() to Open Anotation.

### fise:Enhancement transformation

`fise:Enhancement` instances are represented by `oa:Annotation`. This means that an `{annotation}` instance will be created. The following metadata are added to the `{annotation}` instance

* `dct:created` is mapped to `oa:annotatedAt`
* `dct:modified` is copied as is
* `dct:creator` is mapped to `oa:annotatedBy`
* `dct:contributor` is also mapped to `oa:annotatedBy`
* the `oa:serializedAt` property is set to the current time of the transformation
* the `oa:serializedBy` property is set to the enhancement engine performing the transformation

In addition a `{sptarget}` with the `rdf:type` `oa:SpecificResource` is created for each `fise:Enhancement`. The `fise:extracted-from` is mapped to `oa:hasSource` meaning that the URI of the _Content Item_ is set as source of the annotation.

### fise:TextAnnotation transformation

As `fise:TextAnnotation` are used in Stanbol for different annotation types for the Fusepool Annotation model the mappings are not only applied based on the type but also based on the values of other properties. This section will first describe general mapping rules and later define specific rules for different types in own sub-sections.

Every `fise:TextAnnotation` is also a `fise:Enhancement`. So based on the  [mapping rules for fise:Enhancements](#fiseenhancement_transformation) a `{annotation}` and a `{sptarget}` is created. The URI used by the `fise:TextAnnotation` is used for the `{annotation-body}` that is referenced by `oa:hasBody` from the `{annotation}`

`fise:TextAnnotation` may select parts of the content. This is indicated by the presence of both the `fise:start` and `fise:end` property. For all `fise:TextAnnotation` that define a selection a `{selector}` resource is created and linked with `oa:hasSelector` from the `{sptarget}`. The following rules apply for `{selector}`

* The URI of the `{selector}` is generated by appending a [RFC 5147](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5147) based URI fragments - as used by [NIF 2.0](http://persistence.uni-leipzig.org/nlp2rdf/) - to the URI of the `{content-item}`
* The `{selector}` uses the `rdf:type` `oa:TextPositionSelector` and `oa:TextQuoteSelector` types
* `fise:start` mapped to `oa:start`
* `fise:end` mapped to `oa:end`
* `fise:selected-text` mapped to `oa:exact`. _NOTE_ if `fise:selection-head` and `fise:selection-tail` are used instead of `fise:selected-text` they are copied to the selector and `oa:exact` will be missing.
* `fise:selection-prefix` mapped to `oa:prefix`
* `fise:selection-suffix` mapped to `oa:suffix`

#### fam:LanguageAnnotation transformation

`fise:TextAnnotation` with the `dct:type` `dct:LinguisticSystem` are mapped to `fam:LanguageAnnotation` instances by using the following mappings:

* the `{annotation-body}` does use the `rdf:type` `fam:LanguageAnnotation`
* `dct:language` as defined by the `fise:TextAnnotation`
* `fise:confidence` mapped to `fam:confidence`

#### fam:TopicClassification transformation

`fise:TextAnnotation` with an incoming `dct:relation` from an `fise:TopicAnnotation` instance are mapped to `fam:TopicClassification` instances. In such cases the following mappings apply

* the `{annotation-body}` does use the `rdf:type` `fam:TopicClassification` and `oa:Sequence`
* the `fam:classification-scheme` property will not be set as this information is not available
* `fise:confidence` (if present) is mapped to `fam:confidence`

#### fam:TextAnnotation transformation

All remaining `fise:TextAnnotation` can be converted to `fam:TextAnnotation` instances. For this transformation the following mappings apply:

* `fise:selected-text` is mapped to `fam:entity-mention`
* `dct:type` is mapped to `fam:entity-type`
* `fise:confidence` is mapped to `fam:confidence`

_NOTE:_ that the `oa:Choice` type is added to the `fam:TextAnnotation` when mapping `fise:EntityAnnotation` instances.
    
### fise:EntityAnnotation transformation

All `fise:EntityAnnotation` instances are transformed to `fam:EntityAnnotation`. 

Typically `fise:EntityAnnotation` are linked with `dct:related` to one or more `fise:TextAnnotation`. Those `fise:TextAnnotation` define the mentions of the Entity in the analysed text. In FISE Entity Annotation do not define their own selector as the selection is provided by the linked Entity Annotation. Open Annotation does use a different model, where the `{annotation-body}` for the `fam:EntityAnnotation` will link to all `{selector}` instances for its mentions. Based on the mapping rules for [Entity Annotation](#fiseentityannotation_transformation) such `{selector}` instances are already written and SHOULD BE reused while transforming the `fise:EntityAnnotation`

When transforming `fise:EntityAnnotation` one needs also to modify `fam:TextAnnotation` for linked `fise:TextAnnotation`. For that it is important to not that those `fam:TextAnnotation` instances will use the same URIs as the original `fise:TextAnnotation`. So when transforming `fise:EntityAnnotation` one needs to add the `oa:Choice` type to `fam:TextAnnotation` with the same URI as `fise:TextAnnotation` referenced with the `dct:relation` property. One needs also to write a `oa:item` relation between those `fam:TextAnnotation` instances and the transformed `fam:EntityAnnotation`.

In the following are the complete transformation rules for `fise:EntityAnnotation` instances:

1. Every `fise:EntityAnnotation` is also a `fise:Enhancement`. So based on the  [mapping rules for fise:Enhancements](#fiseenhancement_transformation) a `{annotation}` and a `{sptarget}` is created. The `{sptarget}` links with the `oa:hasSource` to the URI of the `{content-item}`. At this stage no `{selector}` are created.
2. The URI used by the `fise:EntityAnnotation` is used for the `{annotation-body}` that is referenced by `oa:hasBody` from the `{annotation}`. The `{annotation-body}` gets the `rdf:type` `fam:EntityAnnotation`. The following property mappings apply for the `{annotation-body}`
    * `fise:entity-reference` is mapped to `fam:entity-reference`
    * `fise:entity-label` is mapped to `fam:entity-label`
    * `fise:entity-type` is not mapped as the new annotation model does not provide type information as part of the `fam:EntityAnnotation`. Implementors may provide an option to copy `fise:entity-type` values over to the `fam:EntityAnnotation`.
    * if present the `entityhub:site` property referring the Entityhub site holding the controlled vocabulary is copied over to the `fam:EntityAnnotation`.
    * `fise:confidence` is mapped to `fam:confidence`
    * `fise:extracted-from` is mapped to `fam:extracted-from`. It provides a shortcut from the `{annotation-body}` to the `{content-item}`
3. For all `fise:TextAnnotation` instances linked via `dct:related` the following transformations need to be preformed
    * The `rdf:type` `oa:Choice` has to be added to the `fam:TextAnnotation` with the same URI as the processed `fise:TextAnnotation`
    * The `fam:TextAnnotation` with the same URI as the processed `fise:TextAnnotation` needs to be connected to the `fam:EntityAnnotation` by using `oa:item`.
    * All `{selector}` instances referenced by the `fam:TextAnnotation` with the same URI as the processed `fise:TextAnnotation` need also to be referenced with both `{sptarget} oa:hasSelector {selector}` and `{annotation-body} fam:selector {selector}`. This ensures that the `fam:EntityAnnotation` defines selector for all its mentions in the analyzed text
    
### fise:TopicAnnotation transformation

FISE uses `fise:TopicAnnotation` instances linked to a `fise:TextAnnotation` for representing topic classifications of a document (or parts of a document if the Text Annotation selects parts of the text). The Fusepool Annotation Model defines the `fam:TopicClassification` and the `fam:TopicAnnotation` for that purpose.

Mapping rules for `fise:TextAnnotation` with linked `fise:TopicAnnotation` to `fma:TopicClassification` are already define in an [earlier section](#famTopicClassification_transformation). This section specifies how to transform the `fise:TopicAnnotation` to `fam:TopicAnnotation` instances.

In the following are the complete transformation rules for `fise:TopicAnnotation` instances:

1. Every `fise:TopicAnnotation` is also a `fise:Enhancement`. So based on the  [mapping rules for fise:Enhancements](#fiseenhancement_transformation) a `{annotation}` and a `{sptarget}` is created. The `{sptarget}` links with the `oa:hasSource` to the URI of the `{content-item}`. At this stage no `{selector}` are created.
2. The URI used by the `fise:TopicAnnottion` is used for the `{annotation-body}` that is referenced by `oa:hasBody` from the `{annotation}`. The `{annotation-body}` gets the `rdf:type` `fam:TopicAnnotation`. The following property mappings apply for the `{annotation-body}` 
    * `fise:entity-reference` is mapped to `fam:topic-reference`
    * `fise:entity-label` is mapped to `fam:topic-label`
    * `fise:entity-type` is not mapped as the new annotation model does not provide type information as part of the `fam:TopicAnnotation`. Implementors may provide an option to copy `fise:entity-type` values over to the `fam:EntityAnnotation`.
    * if present the `entityhub:site` property referring the Entityhub site holding the thesaurus.
    * `fise:confidence` will also be added to the `{annotation-body}`
    * `fise:extracted-from` is mapped to `fam:extracted-from`. It provides a shortcut from the `{annotation-body}` to the `{content-item}`
3. For all `fise:TopicAnnotation` instances linked via `dct:related` the following transformations need to be preformed
    * This expects that a `fam:TopicClassification` was already created for the URI of the linked `fise:TextAnnotation`. If this is not the case this transformation has to be performed as described in the [fam:TopicClassifcation transformation](#famTopicClassification_transformation) section.
    * The `fam:TopicClassification` needs to be connected to the `fam:EntityAnnotation` by using `oa:item`
    * All `{selector}` instances referenced by the `fam:TopicClassification` need also to be referenced with both `{sptarget} oa:hasSelector {selector}` and `{annotation-body} fam:selector {selector}`. This ensures that the `fam:TopicAnnotation` defines the selector for the classified part of the document.
