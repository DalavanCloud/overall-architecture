## Executive Summary

The goal of Fusepool P3 project is to make publishing and processing of public data as linked data easy. For this purpose Fusepool P3 develops a set of of software components that integrate seemlessly by well defined API basing on Linked Data Best Practices and the Linked Data Platform standard.

To ensure longevity of the code and the API developed withing Fusepool the software is designed so that the individual components can be used not only as parts of the overall software, but also individually. The arhitecture is not tied to a particular runtime environment but bases exclusively on web standards. This allows components to be implemented using any language and framework.

The Fusepool P3 process is divided in the following four steps: exploration, extraction, enrichment and delivery. The software provides tools for the last 3 steps:

 * Extraction: Data from various sources and formats is transformed to RDF and thus made usable in the Lined Opend Data (LOD) Cloud.
 * Enrichment: Entity recognition, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Interlinking as well as human processing such as by Crowdsourcing allow to enrich the available data increasing its value to its and to application builders.
 * Delivery: The actual delivery of the data can be separated into makinf it available via Lined Data standards and the actual presentation to the user with apps on desktops and mobile devices.

This document describes the modular architecture of the Fusepool P3 platform. It describes the modularization, the available and planned implementations of modules and shows how the modules play together to implement the usecases and provide the toolkit envisaged by the DOW.

Specification for APIs as well as the source code of a running basic implementation form an integral part of this deliverable.

1. Introduction {.c39 .c21}
===============

This document describes the technical specification for the Fusepool P3
platform, based both on high-level requirements known already at the
beginning of the project and on the concrete requirements, not only from
WP1, but also for all the other technical work packages.

The main goal of the platform in the Fusepool P3 architecture is to
provide an integrated platform where all other components can interact
with based on the Linked Data principles [BernersLee2006]. Therefore
this document also specifies some of the workflows and formats involved.
In addition, Section 4 describes an already running basic
implementation, provided as open source software.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119]. The
word MUST, or the terms REQUIRED or SHALL, mean that the definition is
an absolute requirement of the specification. The phrase "MUST NOT", or
the phrase "SHALL NOT", mean that the definition is an absolute
prohibition of the specification. The word SHOULD, or the adjective
"RECOMMENDED", mean that there may exist valid reasons in particular
circumstances to ignore a particular item, but the full implications
must be understood and carefully weighed before choosing a different
course. The phrase "SHOULD NOT", or the phrase "NOT RECOMMENDED" mean
that there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances when the
particular behavior is acceptable or even useful, but the full
implications should be understood and the case carefully weighed before
implementing any behavior described with this label.

1.1 Uses cases summary {.c2 .c21}
----------------------

The Fusepool P3 project partners Provincia Autonoma di Trento and
Regione Toscana publish Open Data and develop apps in the domain of
tourism for several years. During this time both partners gained
valuable experience in data creation, maintenance and publication.

Many of the published Open Data sets are used in Android or iOS apps
aimed at tourists and/or inhabitants of the region. Some of them are
written by the project partners, other apps by 3rd party developers
which integrate parts of the published Open Data into their own apps.

As of today the data is mainly available in particular data formats like
CSV, KML, XML and JSON. App developers need to download the raw data and
process it using their own ETL (Extract, Transform Load) processes. With
every update of the raw data this process has to be triggered for every
single application where it is used. If the format of the raw data
changed, the process has to be adjusted and cannot be automated. With
every new data source, maintenance complexity of these Open Data sets
and its apps increases.

Linked Data can help to solve these problems: Data is made available in
a standard format (RDF) which provides among others the following
benefits^[[1]](#ftnt1)^:

-   Every piece of information (data) has its own identifier (URI/IRI).
-   Those identifiers can be resolved via the web (HTTP),
-   which acts as a generalized API for developers.
-   Standardised vocabularies describe the meaning of the data,
-   and allow to relate information with each other.

The Linked Data technology stack [Bizer2009] provides many ways to
interact with data in RDF format [Cyganiak2014]. This greatly reduces
the overhead needed to integrate data sets into apps and thus increases
the value of Open Data. However, one needs new ETL processes to
transform raw data to Linked Data. While it facilitates data usage for
app developers, Linked Data requires initially more work by the data
owner and publisher.

In the past years many powerful tools got developed or extended to
support creation and maintenance of Linked Data. Also new W3C standards
and vocabularies are developed for turning legacy data into Linked Data.
Many of these tools and standards are developed, extended or implemented
by Fusepool P3 project partners. What is lacking is a "cockpit" for the
tools, a place where our project partners Provincia Autonoma di Trento
and Regione Toscana and other potential users can easily automate those
ETL processes and generate Linked Data.

The creation of this cockpit is the purpose of the Fusepool P3 project.
The platform itself is built on top of emerging Linked Data standards
like the Linked Data Platform (LDP) specification and integrates
state-of-the-art tools like OpenRefine, OpenLink Virtuoso, Apache
Stanbol, and Pundit.

The Fusepool P3 platform is developed and tested based on the
requirements by Provincia Autonoma di Trento and Regione Toscana. Both
partners start working with the platform in an early stage and feedback
gets directly integrated into the agile development process of Fusepool
P3.

2. Architecture {.c39 .c21}
===============

Based on the requirements analysis and some architectural principles
proposals^[[2]](#ftnt2)^,^[[3]](#ftnt3)^, the following figure depicts
the high-level architecture for the Fusepool P3 platform:

![](images/image02.png)

Components drawn with blue components are generic ones that are part of
the generic platform. The generic platform is a set generic and standard
interfaces, mainly LDP 1.0  [Speicher2014] and SPARQL 1.1 [SPARQL11],
that can be provided by different concrete implementations. In this
project, the official concrete implementations that the partners bring
into the consortium are Apache Marmotta^[[4]](#ftnt4)^ from SRFG and
OpenLink Virtuoso^[[5]](#ftnt5)^ from OGL, also other third-party
implementations MAY be also supported. Some more concrete requirements
for those interfaces will be described below.

The remained components, drawn with yellow in the previous picture, are
the actual components that comprise the Fusepool P3 platform. Users are
expected to consume the data via a proxy which transparently handles
transformation processes by calling in background the actual
transformers, and sending back the data to the platform once the process
has finished. All these component are going to be described in
sufficient detail in the upcoming sections.

This architecture does not make the platform the common runtime for all
components. On the contrary, by default each component, including all
transformers, are individual processes interacting via HTTP as the
interaction interface. An exception to this are the backend related
components (LDP, SPARQL, RDF Triple Store and the possible custom
backend services) which may be more tightly coupled between themselves
(i.e., running under the same runtime) due to non-functional
requirements.

2.1 Components {.c2 .c21}
--------------

The Fusepool P3 platform is composed of three core components: consumer,
transformer API and backends.

### 2.1.1 Consumers {.c2 .c21}

From the point of view of the platform, consumers will be all those
components of the project interacting with the platform. They mainly
will use standard interfaces, such as LDP or SPARQL, that allow the
final users^[[6]](#ftnt6)^ to use the platform in a seamless way. Any
other interaction SHOULD NOT be accepted.

Further details will be described in proper detail in WP4’s
deliverables.

### 2.1.2 Transformers {.c2 .c21}

Data transformation components are responsible for transforming data
from legacy formats (e.g. structured formats like vCard or Facebook
OpenGraph, or unstructured formats like plain text) to RDF. Data
transformations are done by the Transformer API is a simple and
generic API that allows an integrated transformation process within the
Fusepool P3 platform. Here we describe some of the key aspects of the
transformation component - see Section 3.1 for further technical
details:

-   A LDP Transformation Proxy that transparently allows to invoke an
    individual transformers, or a pipeline transformer, using a LDP
    Interaction Model^[[7]](#ftnt7)^ via HTTP. The original data posted
    is always immediately forwarded to the underlined LDP
    implementation. In addition, the result of the transformation will
    also be posted to the same LDPC. Section 2.2.3 provides further
    technical details about this component together a sequence diagram
    describing how it interacts with the underlying LDP implementation.
-   Extended LDP Interaction Model for Transformation: Fusepool P3
    provides an extended LDP Interaction Model to transform data via the
    LDP Transformation Proxy with Fusepool P3. It is a way to associate
    a transformer to an LDPC and a specification on what the client can
    expect when posting contents to such a transformation container. It
    is described as a set of ontological terms under the normative
    namespace http://vocab.fusepool.info/eldp\# .
-   A simple and generic Transformer REST API that all transformers must
    implement. This API provides both description of the transformers as
    well as actual invocation of the transformation services. It
    supports both synchronous and asynchronous request handling, as
    specified later.
-   Different transformers implementations, that are the components
    actually performing the transformation. The term "transform" and the
    derived terms are used very broadly here; it includes processes such
    as annotating and RDFizing content. Therefore, from the nature of
    the transformation tasks, in the current scope we can differentiate
    at least two families of transformers: RDFizers^[[8]](#ftnt8)^,
    those which transform non-RDF data to RDF; annotators, those which
    enrich with RDF annotations data in any format. While RDFizers
    produce schema-less data, annotators will produce a fixed schema
    format as output.
-   There is a special pipeline transformer that, implementing the same
    interface than a regular transformer, will support a more
    sophisticated data lifecycle delegating to several other
    transformers allowing for pipes and possibly other processing
    schemes; for instance performing a transformation with
    OpenRefine^[[9]](#ftnt9)^, that later with be enriched with
    annotations from Stanbol^[[10]](#ftnt10)^.
-   A transformer is identified by a IRI. While it is possible that a
    transformer is an individual implementation it is also common that
    the implementation is rather a transformer factory, that is a
    service that requires additional configuration for actually
    providing a transformer. Section 2.3.1.2 provides further details
    about the naming conventions in this transformer factory.
-   A transformer may request the user to interact with an HTTP resource
    that is provided via a User Interaction Request. The LDPC is used as
    a repository of messages to which a transformer can write to and the
    UI components read from.

### 2.1.4 Backends {.c2 .c21}

All data is persisted to the underlying backend server, which provides
the support for the generic interfaces (LDP and SPARQL) and where the
data will be persisted in a RDF Triple Store. Both Marmotta and Virtuoso
provide a concrete implementations of this generic component.

2.2 Communication {.c2 .c21}
-----------------

Components communicate via REST [Fielding2002] over HTTP [Fielding1999]
between each other. Besides this generic mechanism, the platform
establishes some more concrete communications between some core
components:

-   Components consuming data communicate with the platform mainly using
    LDP via the LDP Transformation Proxy using the Extended LDP
    Interaction Model for Transformation. In addition, SPARQL is also
    provided for some other operations that require query capabilities,
    as well of some custom web services if required.
-   The LDP transformation Proxy communicates with all transformers,
    either regular or pipeline, using the Transformer REST API specified
    at Section 3.1.
-   RDF is used as data model and exchange format in all communications.
    All standard serializations MAY be potentially used, although only
    Turtle [Prudhommeaux2014] MUST be supported by all components.

2.3 Workflows {.c21 .c39}
-------------

### 2.3.1 Registering a transformer {.c39 .c21}

Registries play an important role for the integration of the components
in the UI components driven workflows. Registries are not modeled itself
as components as they are the regular LDP capabilities are used to
maintain these registries. Currently three registries are foreseen:

-   Transformer registry
-   Transformer factory registry
-   User interaction requests registry

The exact vocabularies and usage have not yet been specified, the
following should just give an idea in which direction development is
going.

2.3.1.1 Transformer registry

The registration of transformers is done by using a regular LDP
Interaction Model. The Fusepool P3 platform will register a LDP
Container for known transformers. This registry is used by the client
when creating transformation containers as well as when creating
pipeline transformers.

The following HTTP traces outline some more details about this process.
The necessary request to register a new transformer in the platform,
using the HTTP Slug header [RFC5023] according LDP to request "example"
as unique identifier, would be something like (see Section 3.1 below for
a detailed specification):

[](#)[](#)


    POST /registry

    Host: demo.fusepoolp3.eu

    Slug: example

    Content-Type: text/turtle

    @prefix dct: \<http://purl.org/dc/terms/\> .

    @prefix fp3: \<http://vocab.fusepool.info/fp3\#\> .

    \<.\> a fp3:RegistryEntry;

        fp3:entry \<http://example.org/vcard-transformer\>.

    \<http://example.org/vcard-transformer\> a fp3:TransformationService ;

        dct:title "An example vCard transformer"@en.


the included transformer description HTTP request message body, using
the RDF serialization specified by the Content-Type header. Then, the
response would look like:

[](#)[](#)


    HTTP/1.1 201 Created

    Server: FusepoolP3/0.1.0 (build 2+)

    Location: http://demo.fusepoolp3.eu/registry/example

    Content-Length: 0

    Date: Mon, 16 Jun 2014 08:54:14 GMT


Then, a request to the new entry:

[](#)[](#)


    GET /registry/example

    Host: demo.fusepoolp3.eu

    Accept: text/turtle, application/rdf+xml;q=.8, \*/\*;q=.1


MUST return something like:

[](#)[](#)


    HTTP/1.1 200 OK

    Date: Mon, 16 Jun 2014 08:57:32 GMT

    \<http://example.org/vcard-transformer\> a fp3:TransformationService ;

        dct:title "An example vCard transformer"@en .


2.3.1.2 Transformer factory registry

Similar to the above but what is registered are the IRI of transformer
factory. This IRI, http://service.example.org/openrefine in the example
from Section 2.1.2, MUST dereference to a representation suitable to be
used by a human to create a transformer, ideally a HTML document.

A transformer is identified by a IRI. While it is possible that a
transformer is an individual implementation, it is also common that the
implementation is rather a transformer factory, that is a service that
requires additional configuration for actually providing a transformer.
This additional configuration is typically encoded in the IRI of the
resulting transformers. For example a tranformer for the OpenRefine rule
file located at http://example.org/rules might have the IRI
http://service.example.org/openrefine?rules=http://example.org/rules the
transformer factory could have the  IRI:
http://service.example.org/openrefine, it is important to note that the
latter IRI does not identify a transformer. Transformers provided by the
same transformer factory will typically share the same runtime. Note
that the choice of runtime is up to the implementation. In this
architecture there are no requirement on the runtime environment, as
long as it implemented the Transformation REST API.

2.3.1.3 User interaction request registry

When a transformer or another component needs human interaction it may
request user interaction by adding a IRI to the user interaction request
registry.^[[a]](#cmnt1)^^[[b]](#cmnt2)^ The IRI shall dereference to a
resource allowing a human user to perform the requested interaction.
Once the interaction completed the component shall remove the user
interaction request from this registry.

### 2.3.2 Creating a Transformation Container {.c2 .c21}

LDP does not specify how containers are created. Whatever means, the
underlying LDP implementation supports to create container that as
suitable method to create transformation containers. It should allow to
add an fp3:transformer property linking the transformer from the created
container.^[[c]](#cmnt3)^^[[d]](#cmnt4)^ A Fusepool P3 compliant LDP
implementation MUST support the creation of containers by posting them
to the transformers root container.

[](#)[](#)


    POST /ldp/transformation

    Host: demo.fusepoolp3.eu

    Slug: example

    Content-Type: text/turtle

    @prefix dct: \<http://purl.org/dc/terms/\> .

    @prefix fp3: \<http://vocab.fusepool.info/fp3\#\> .

    @prefix eldp: \<http://vocab.fusepool.info/eldp\#\> .

    \<.\> a eldp:TransformationContainer , ldp:DirectContainer ;

        :transformer \<http://example.org/vcard-transformer\> .


The server response MUST have status code 201 and MUST contain a
location header specifying the IRI of the created resource

[](#)[](#)


    HTTP/1.1 201 Created

    Server: FusepoolP3/0.1.0-SNAPSHOT (build 2+)

    Last-Modified: Mon, 16 Jun 2014 08:54:14 GMT

    ETag: W/"14028798789"

    rel="type"

    Content-Length: 0

    Date: Mon, 16 Jun 2014 08:54:14 GMT


In the above example the response contains some additional information:

-   The Link header with rel="describedby" may indicate some
    implementation restrictions, in this case all details around the LDP
    Transformation Proxy that will be described with more detail in
    following sections of this document.
-   The Link headers with rel="type" indicates the type of the created
    resource in the  LDP hierarchy, where the Fusepool P3 workflow adds
    a non-normative type denoting the extended interaction model.

A GET request to the newly created container at
http://demo.fusepoolp3.eu/ldp/transformation/example could look like
this:

[](#)[](#)


    GET /ldp/transformation/example HTTP/1.1

    Host: demo.fusepoolp3.eu

    Accept: text/turtle; charset=UTF-8

    Prefer: return=representation;

Response:

[](#)[](#)


    HTTP/1.1 200 OK

    Content-Type: text/turtle; charset=UTF-8

    ETag: "\_87e52ce2917987"

    Content-Length: 477

      a eldp:TransformationContainer, ldp:DirectContainer ;

      dcterms:title "An transformation LDP Container for vCard" ;

      ldp:membershipResource
    \<http://demo.fusepoolp3.eu/ldp/transformation/example\> ;

      ldp:hasMemberRelation ldp:member ;

      ldp:insertedContentRelation ldp:MemberSubject ;

      dp:transformer \<http://example.org/vcard-transformer\> .


With a supported RDF format in the Accept header the request MUST yield
to a response entity serializing a graph with at least the triple with
the fp3:transformer predicate.

### 2.3.3 Adding content to a Transformer Container {.c2 .c21}

Data is ingested in the platform also using regular LDP interaction. The
proxy transparently handles the transformation process, normally when
posting LDP-NRs (Linked Data Platform Non-RDF Source resources) to the
special transformation containers. The following sequence diagram
depicts the high-level synchronous interaction:

![](images/image00.png)

Coming down into more detail, in the case of a synchronous
transformation, the client HTTP interaction is rather simple. The client
posts data to the LDPC:

[](#)[](#)


    POST /ldp/transformation/example

    Host: demo.fusepoolp3.eu

    Accept: text/turtle, application/rdf+xml;q=.8, \*/\*;q=.1

    Content-Type: text/vcard

    Slug: corks

    Content-Length: 164

    BEGIN:VCARD

    VERSION:4.0

    FN:Corky Crystal

    NICKNAME:Corks

    TEL;TYPE=home,voice;VALUE=uri:tel:+61755555555

    EMAIL:corky@example.com

    REV:20080424T195243Z

    END:VCARD


And it gets back the the IRI of the newly created resource

[](#)[](#)


    HTTP/1.1 201 OK

    Date: Mon, 16 Jun 2014 09:01:52 GMT

    Connection: close

    Location: http://demo.fusepoolp3.eu/ldp/transformation/example/corks


The newly created resource will immediately be a member of the
container. The results of the transformer will be available as a member
of the container after the transformer terminates the transformation.
Internally the proxy handles the invocation to the endpoint provided by
the concrete transformer, and the storage of the data.

So when a GET request is sent after transformation completed the
interaction might look as follows:

[](#)[](#)


    GET /ldp/transformation/example HTTP/1.1

    Host: demo.fusepoolp3.eu

    Accept: text/turtle; charset=UTF-8


And the response SHOULD look like:

[](#)[](#)


    HTTP/1.1 200 OK

    Content-Type: text/turtle; charset=UTF-8

    ETag: "\_87e52ce2917987"

Asynchronous transformations are specified with detail later at Section
3.1.

2.4 Requirements {.c39 .c21}
----------------

As the general architecture describes, the Fusepool P3 platform is built
on top of some standard technologies implemented (LDP 1.0, SPARQL 1.1,
etc), where some concrete non-functional requirements need to be
satisfied

### 2.4.1 LDP {.c2 .c21}

Linked Data Platform 1.0 [Speicher2014], commonly abbreviated as LDP, is
a W3C technology which proposes to use HTTP for accessing, updating,
creating and deleting resources from servers that expose their resources
as Linked Data. It provides clarifications and extensions of the rules
of Linked Data [BernersLee2006]. LDP uses standard HTTP and RDF
techniques for constructing clients and servers that create, read, and
write Linked Data Platform Resources (LDPR). The specification defines a
special type of Linked Data Platform Resource: a Container (LDPC).
Containers are very useful in building application models involving
collections of resources, often homogeneous ones. Resources can be added
to containers using standard HTTP operations like POST.

Besides a general purpose LDP 1.0 implementation compliant with the
specification^[[11]](#ftnt11)^, for the concrete needs of the project it
has to provide at least:

-   Implementation MUST support the creation of containers by posting
    them to a transformation container.
-   In addition to the normative LDP properties, it MUST be allowed to
    post arbitrary properties to a LDPC.
-   Further more, the underlying LDP implementation has to support to
    transparently run behind the LDP Proxy, concretely this means the
    LDPC must not assume the requested IRI to reflect the port it is
    listening to.

### 2.4.2 Persistence {.c2 .c21}

Concrete implementations of the Fusepool P3 platform backends must
supports LDP 1.0 [Speicher2014] and SPARQL 1.1 [SPARQL11] to provide
persistence support to all components of the Fusepool P3 platform.

Internal implementation details are out of the scope of this document.
But it is encouraged that implementations may support standard
mechanisms, such as the Sesame SAIL API^[[12]](#ftnt12)^, to support
different storage solutions. That is one the mechanisms the project is
currently working to provide LDP support via Marmotta over the Virtuoso
triplestore^[[13]](#ftnt13)^, for example. In addition, the project is
also developing some mixed approaches, such as providing LDP support
over SPARQL 1.1^[[14]](#ftnt14)^. But so far these are just experiments
to lower the level of requirements required by the platform beyond these
formal requirements.

All these details will be further described in the deliverable D5.3,
Data storage access via generic RDF API.

### 2.4.3 Other requirements {.c2 .c21}

All non-functional requirements are out of the scope of this document.
Broader functional project requirements are described in details by
deliverable D1.1 (Use cases and data specified, data modelled and
prepared).

 {.c24 .c21}

 {.c24 .c21}

3. Specifications {.c39 .c21}
=================

3.1 Transformation API {.c2 .c21}
----------------------

This section defines an API for data transforming components. This
section describes the first version of the Transformation
API^[[15]](#ftnt15)^, which may evolve in the future at
github^[[16]](#ftnt16)^.

The term "transform" and the derived terms are used very broadly here;
it includes processes such as annotating and RDFizing content.
Therefore, a transformer is transformation service identified and
accessible via an HTTP(S) IRI, while an implementation is the actual
server processing requests against a transformer IRI.

### 3.1.1 Introduction {.c2 .c21}

A Transformation Service (aka Transformer) is represented by an
dereferenceable IRI, representing a resource of type trans:Transformer.
A GET request of the resource will return a description of the service.
At least Turtle [Prudhommeaux2014] MUST be supported as base format to
describe RDF resources, although other RDF serialization could be also
supported. A POST request does the actual transformation of the
data. This is a very generic mechanism designed to interface simple
services that can do a very specific transformation as well as services
that interface a complex pipe or routing mechanism to handle many input
and output formats. Such a more complex service might well delegate to
more simple services that also expose the interface.

### 3.1.2 Transformers {.c2 .c21}

Implementation MUST support the GET method for Transformers.
Implementations MUST accept at least requests for text/turtle
representations. Implementations MAY support other RDF and non-RDF
formats. If an acceptable request is answered with a response entity in
a format serializing an RDF graph this graph must contain at least:

-   Exactly one triple with the Transformer as subject, rdf:type as
    predicate and trans:Transformer as object.
-   At least one triple with the Transformer as subject and
    trans:supportedInputFormat as predicate.
-   At least one triple with the Transformer as subject and
    trans:supportedOutputFormat as predicate.

Implementations SHOULD return a triple with the Transformer as subject
and trans:supportedOutputFormat as predicate and a media type as
xsd:StringValue of the object for any media-type that might be the
format of the result of a successful transformation.

Implementations  support POST requests, where SHOULD accept request
entities of all media-types matching a value of one of
the trans:supportedInputFormat properties of the Transformer contained
in the RDF representation returned on GET requests when interpreting
this value as media-range the same way as the media-range is for
Accept header values as per section 14.1 of RFC2616 [RFC2616].

In the case of a piped transformation, a special transformer will be
provided including the required capabilities. Such transformer would
allow to pipe together different transformations.

### 3.1.3 Integration with LDP {.c39 .c21}

The integration of the Transformer API with the the underlying LDP
implementation is defined as an extension to the LDP specification to
allow special containers to execute a transformation task when a member
resource is added via a POST request. This section describes the first
version^[[17]](#ftnt17)^,  which may evolve in the future at
github^[[18]](#ftnt18)^.

Basically the process is such: if the representation contains a triple
with the LDPC as subject and eldp:transformer as predicate, an
implementation MUST invoke the trans:Transformer identified by the
object of this triple whenever a LDP-NR is created following a POST
request to the Transformer LDPC. The request against the
trans:Transformer SHOULD be executed using the data transmission
specified below. The POST request SHOULD return according to section
5.2.3.1 of LDP without waiting for the Transformer to complete. If the
transformation successful completes, the results SHOULD be added to the
same container. If the transformation result is RDF, a new triple like:

[](#)[](#)


    \<{transformation result}, eldp:transformedFrom, {transformation
    source}\>


SHOULD be added to the transformation result LDPR; where {transformation
result} is the resource representing the transformation result and
{transformation source} is the original LDP-NR that was used a source of
the transformation.

### 3.1.5 Data transmission {.c2 .c21}

Implementations MAY honor the Prefer header [RFC7240] for the selection
of the method used for data transmission. The Prefer header is an HTTP
header field that can be used by a client to request that certain
behaviors be employed by a server while processing a request. The
Prefer request header field is used to indicate that particular server
behaviors are preferred by the client but are not required for
successful completion of the request. The wait preference can be used to
establish an upper bound on the length of time, in seconds, the client
expects it will take the server to process the request once it has been
received. Prefer is similar in nature to the Expect header field
[RFC7231] with the exception that servers are allowed to ignore stated
preferences. The Preference-Applied response header MAY be included
within a response message as an indication as to which Prefer tokens
were honored by the server and applied to the processing of a request.

The default behaviour is upon to each concrete transformer.
Implementations SHOULD NOT assume that a client is sending a request
without specifying a respond-async preference prefers a synchronous
response.

3.1.5.1 Synchronous data transmision

If the implementations chooses to handle the request synchronously
(Prefer: return=representation) and the transformation succeeds, it MUST
respond with status code 200. The result of the transformation MUST be
returned as the response entity. If the request fails because of an
error in the POSTed entity, implementations SHOULD answer the request
with status code 400 and a response entity explaining the error.

3.1.5.2 Asynchronous data transmision

If the implementation chooses to handle the request asynchronously
(Prefer: respond-async) and the request is acceptable in that the value
of the Accept header as the Media-Type of request entity is acceptable
the implementations MUST respond with status code 202. The
transformation will be executed in background, returning a
Location header pointing to the transformation job IRI, where:

-   As long as the transformation has not completed implementations MUST
    respond with status code 202 to GET requests. The response entity
    will describe the current status of the job in RDF, where at least
    Turtle SHOULD be supported as basic serialization. The graph
    serialized by the response entity SHOULD contain, at least, a triple
    with job IRI as subject, trans:status as property and
    trans:Processing as object.
-   After the request is successfully completed, implementations MUST
    respond to GET requests with status code 303 and Location header
    pointing to the transformation result.

If the transformation can not be processed, implementations SHOULD
return 400 error, including with some explanation about the causes of
the error. If the transformation failed, implementations SHOULD return
500 error, including with some explanation about the causes of the
error.

3.2 Annotation data model {.c2 .c21}
-------------------------

In Fusepool P3 annotators are expected to produce annotation from
textual content, either unstructured or extracted from any other
structured format. All annotators MUST produce a common annotation model
as described by this section. This is important to pipe annotators,
allowing configurations using multiple annotation services.

The base structure of this Annotation Model will be fully compatible
with Open Annotation [Sanderson2013], but defining some additional
relations to ease the consumption - especially the retrieval of
Selectors for Annotations. The following figure provides an overview on
the chosen model.

![fp-anno-model.png](images/image03.png)

Annotations describe (annotate) associations between related resources.
An annotation based on the Fusepool P3 Annotation Model will consist of
the following parts:

-   oa:Annotation providing metadata and provenance information about
    the produced annotations
-   oa:SpecialResource acting as mediator between the optional
    oa:Selector and the source
-   the source represented by the IRI of the annotated text
-   an annotation body that formally describes the annotation

A fam:selector property is introduced to provide a shortcut between the
annotation body and the 0..\* selectors. The fam:extracted-from property
provides a direct link between the annotation body and the source. Those
two properties allow a annotation body centric consumption of annotator
results. Then clients, instead of manually joining over the intermediate
resources (?annotation and ?sptarget) with a SPARQL query like:

[](#)[](#)


    PREFIX oa: \<http://www.w3.org/ns/oa\#\>

    SELECT ?body ?source ?selector

    WHERE {

      ?annotation a oa:Annotation ;

        oa:hasBody ?body ;

        oa:hasTarget ?sptarget .

      ?body a fam:TextAnnotation ;

        oa:hasBody ?body .

      ?sptarget oa:SpecificResource ;

        oa:hasSource ?source ;

        oa:hasSelector ?selector .

    }


 Instead they can directly retrieve the required information with a much
simpler and faster query:

[](#)[](#)


    PREFIX oa: \<http://www.w3.org/ns/oa\#\>

    PREFIX fam: \<http://vocab.fusepool.info/fam\#\>

    SELECT ?body ?source ?selector

    WHERE {

      ?body a fam:TextAnnotation ;

        fam:extracted-from ?source ;

        fam:selector ?selector .

    }


In addition to this core structure model the Fusepool Annotation model
also defines a set of Annotation Types for the annotation of different
analysis results:

1.  Language Annotation: used to describe the Language of the analysed
    text
2.  Text Annotation: used to describe Named Entities detected in the
    text. Such entities can originate from Named Entity Recognition
    (NER) tools annotators that detect mentions of Entities based on
    Dictionaries
3.  Entity Annotation: used to suggest Entities part of some kind of
    controlled vocabulary for mentions in the text. Entity Annotations
    are suggestions for Text Annotations. The oa:Choice construct is
    used for modelling those
4.  Topic Annotation: used to classify a document along topics defined
    in some classification scheme (e.g. skos:Concepts part of a
    skos:ConceptScheme)

All those Annotation Types will act as annotation bodies as defined in
the core annotation structure. Annotation Types are extensible. This
allows Annotations whose analysis results are not covered by the
predefined Annotation Types to define their own.

This section defines the first version of the Fusepool P3 Annotation
Model^[[19]](#ftnt19)^, which will be specified in detail in the future
by deliverable D5.2, Data retrieval for semantic enrichment/processing
and semantic indexes for domain specific data retrieval.

3.3 Access control {.c39 .c21}
------------------

Access Control is a mechanism through which an agent (in this case the
platform) permits to perform certain operations on resources as
specified by concrete policies. Within this document, the resources are
RDF resources, exposed either by LDP or SPARQL, and the access control
will not operate at a different granularity (graphs or triples). When
access control come into play, the platform must restrict some
operations on some resources. These operations are the typically
described by the RESTful principles.

Access control is a recognized open issue when interacting with RDF /
Linked Data using HTTP methods [Costabello2013], and LDP 1.0 is not yet
seriously addressing such issue^[[20]](#ftnt20)^. Therefore please
notice that the platform will not go beyond the state of the art on this
aspect; i.e., we are not going to provide a new access control proposal.
But the Fusepool P3 platform is just going to implement the best
possible solution for the goals of the project among the different
alternatives already available out there.

Given the proposed architecture, where all the interaction to the
platform is done via the LDP Transformation Proxy Layer (further details
can be found at Sections 2.1 and 3.1), access control not relying on
HTTP Headers (e.g. WebID) must be at least partially be handled by a
proxy handling the requests as they come in^[[e]](#cmnt5)^. This means
that a HTTPS proxy might handle the request before the requests are
processed by the LDP Transformation Proxy described above. This HTTPS
Proxy can of course rely on information stored in the proxied LDP
implementation describing the users and their rights. Following the
design principle of Separation of Concerns (SoC) the LDP Transformation
Proxy only implements HTTP, no TLS/SSL support over HTTPS.
^[[f]](#cmnt6)^^[[g]](#cmnt7)^^[[h]](#cmnt8)^^[[i]](#cmnt9)^Therefore
such circumstance needs to be properly handled when designing the access
control mechanisms. For all these reasons, access controls is not yet
part of the basic implementation delivered together with this report.
There are still many issues to clarify before we would be able to
provide a specification that could fit in the overall architecture.

The access control mechanisms of the particular Linked Data Platform
(Apache Marmotta or OpenLink Virtuoso) providing the base layers of the
FP3 framework (the blue components in the architecture diagram on
Section 2), are likely to be vendor specific to some degree. The
following sections describe the concrete access control features which
could be used by the Fusepool platform. Whether a generic access control
interface could be defined for the FP3 platform remains an item for
discussion^[[j]](#cmnt10)^. Such a generic interface would seek to hide
differences in access control configuration between the alternative
Linked Data platforms which might provide the base storage layer. In the
absence of a generic interface, the access control configuration might
remain platform specific, but the effects of the access control as seen
by the client, for example the reporting of access restrictions, should
be consistent irrespective of the chosen storage platform.

### 3.3.1 Marmotta access control {.c2 .c21}

Apache Marmotta implements some basic mechanisms for access control. By
default HTTP Basic authentication [Fielding1999] is used for
authentication and authorization^[[21]](#ftnt21)^, both for all web
services (SPARQL, LDP, etc) and the administration user interface. The
configuration is based on ACL rules, using users and roles, grouped in
profiles for simplifying permission management.

In addition, Marmotta also has experimental support for fine-grained
access-control within the RDF triples^[[22]](#ftnt22)^ by providing
access control over a Sesame SAIL using PPO [Sacco2011]. Although in
principle such granularity level of access control would not be required
by the project, as discussed above. The roadmap of the project also
includes other authentication technologies, such as
WebID^[[23]](#ftnt23)^ or OAuth^[[24]](#ftnt24)^, which also could be
addressed with the implementation of the Fusepool P3 platform. In the
end the evolution of the requirements, both internal in the project and
external^[[25]](#ftnt25)^, should guide that process.

### 3.3.2 Virtuoso access control {.c2 .c21}

Virtuoso provides numerous options for access control - some specific to
a particular realm. For instance:

-   Protected SPARQL endpoints associated with specific authentication
    methods, e.g. /sparql-auth, /sparql-oauth, /sparql-webid
    [Fielding1999, Hardt2012, Story2009, Recordon2006].
-   SPARQL roles restrict the types of SPARQL commands a database user
    may perform.
-   Graph level security allows the setting of permissions bit masks to
    set the read/write (and sponge) permissions on specific RDF graphs
    to control public access or specific users.

However, OpenLink’s preferred generic access control mechanism for
Virtuoso is VAL, its Virtualized Authentication Layer^[[26]](#ftnt26)^.
VAL provides a virtualized layer that loosely couples: Identifiers
(WebIDs  that denote Agents), Identification (WebID-Profile documents
that describe Agents), Authentication (WebID-TLS and other protocols for
Identification claims verification), and Authorization (via the use of
ACLs or Data Access policies represented in RDF). VAL enables protection
of any HTTP and SQL (via ODBC or JDBC connections) accessible
resource(s). Thus, it provides the basis for controlling access to LDP
resources exposed by the Virtuoso LDP, for protecting Virtuoso SPARQL
endpoints or specific RDF store named graphs, or WebDAV resources etc.

3.3.2.1 VAL vs LDP WG Requirements for Access Control

VAL offers a superset of the LDP access control requirements outlined by
the Linked Data Platform Working Group^[[27]](#ftnt27)^. It broadly
supports the following W3C requirements:

-   Access Control Graphs - which describe which agents have access to
    which resources and the modes of access allowed.
-   Access control on HTTP manipulation of resources.
-   Editability of access control rules using HTTP.
-   Agents can authenticate themselves to the server with an identifier
    or as the owner of a token.
-   Ability to specify access privileges at a fine-grained level.
-   Ability to specify a collection of agents or resources, identified
    by IRIs or IRI patterns.

3.3.2.2 Virtuoso Authentication Layer (VAL)

VAL provides both authentication and access control services through an
internal Virtuoso API or by two public HTTP APIs, a ‘standard’ HTTP API
and a RESTful variant, which manage rules and groups via their URLs.
Both are Turtle-based. All the VAL authentication mechanisms are
supported.

Users attempting to access a VAL-protected resource must first login and
authenticate themselves through a VAL-supplied authentication dialog.
After establishing a VAL session, their access permissions on the
resource are checked. Virtuoso LDP resources and containers could be
protected in this way, once the required VAL hooks are in place.

The supported authentication methods are:

-   HTTP authentication (for Virtuoso SQL and WebDAV user accounts)
-   Basic PKI, BrowserID, OpenID, WebID-TLS
-   Third party OAuth services:

-   Numerous services including Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and Google.
-   Note: Not all OAuth services require a Virtuoso SSL endpoint. Such
    services would remove the need for the LDP Transformation Proxy to
    support HTTPS.

VAL’s generic ACL layer is based in its entirety on RDF statements and
entity relations logic, so rules, groups, authorization grants etc., are
all in the form of RDF statements persisted to  private graphs in the
RDF store. Authorization rules are described using terms from the  W3C
ACL ontology^[[28]](#ftnt28)^ and the OpenLink ACL
ontology^[[29]](#ftnt29)^. This system also supports restrictions which
restrict arbitrary values based on the authenticated user. These can be
used to limit the number of query results, enforce quotas etc.

VAL ACL Rule System Overview

The ACL rule system allows any authenticated person (including any
3rd-party service IDs which have no corresponding Virtuoso SQL account)
to create ACL rules for any resource they own or they have grant rights
for. A resource is any entity identified by a IRI. This could be an LDPR
or LDPC, or an transformer. VAL manages and reports the permissions on
the resource, but the logic supporting the resource access is
responsible for enforcing those permissions.

Rules and groups are stored in private named graphs within the triple
store, as are resource ownership details. The rules grant read, write or
sponge permission on a resource, or the ability to grant these
permissions. Custom permissions can also be defined.

Below is a basic example of an ACL rule granting read access to a
user[ ](http://www.facebook.com/foobar)authenticating
through their Facebook login,
http://www.facebook.com/jsmith,[ ](http://www.facebook.com/foobar)to
resource[ ](http://me.com/bla:)[http://demo.fusepoolp3.eu/assets](http://me.com/bla:)[:](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fme.com%2Fbla%3A&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNEjbn_dlaw160Ie3HR8pdTmgZmXXw)

In addition to individual person ACLs granting access to an individual,
rules can grant access to a simple group, a conditional group, or
everyone, i.e. make a resource public. Rather than consisting of a list
of members, conditional groups define a set of conditions. These
conditions typically test attributes of the X.509 client certificate
provided by the authenticated user’s WebID, but can also be conditions
evaluated as part of a SPARQL ASK query. Every authenticated person
matching these conditions is seen as part of the group. VAL’s
Conditional Groups feature provides the basis for Attribute Based Access
Control (ABAC^[[30]](#ftnt30)^).

4. Basic Implementation {.c2 .c21}
=======================

The basic implementation of the Fusepool P3 platform can be found at
GitHub^[[31]](#ftnt31)^, and the first release (0.1.0) has been recently
published there^[[32]](#ftnt32)^. It is available under a
business-friendly open source license^[[33]](#ftnt33)^, and consists on
a Apache Maven^[[34]](#ftnt34)^ multi-module project that manages the
overall development lifecycle of all required components:

-   LDP Transformation Proxy.
-   Transformation libraries and interfaces definitions.
-   Generic workers, such as Apache Stanbol^[[35]](#ftnt35)^ for
    information extraction tasks.
-   Actual platform backends, such as Apache Marmotta or other that will
    come.
-   A basic bash-based^[[36]](#ftnt36)^ launcher to start/stop all
    integrated components in a seamless way.

In addition a public continuous integration server [Fowler2006] is
available^[[37]](#ftnt37)^, continuously building the platform on every
new commit to the code, automatically reporting the results to the
developers.

4.1 Methodology {.c39 .c21}
---------------

The working plan for the platform is based on the common software
engineering concept of "always throw the prototype away" [Brooks1975] in
conjunction with the philosophy of "release early, release often"
[Raymond1999]. We are aware that many decisions may be wrong. Or even if
they are right we have produced a bad implementation out of it. But the
main idea was to quickly prototype a platform that would not blocked the
work of the other parts in the project. The idea is to incrementally
build and evolve the platform together with the other  technical work
packages.

Once the first milestone of the project was accomplished, the project
already has a working platform, something that is ready to be used for
stating to develop and integrate all the other components. In parallel,
the platform will be also evaluated by external stakeholders that will
provide the necessary feedback to feed the following development
iterations. The Scrum methodology [Takeuchi1986] internally used for the
project development will try deliver quickly and respond to all these
emerging requirements.

4.2 Deployment architecture {.c2 .c21 .c32}
---------------------------

All component can run on any platform that can expose HTTP services. The
components of the reference implementation may require some common
runtimes readily available on common platforms.

In the initial development iterations a set of basic bash scripts is
provided to startup the whole platform on Unix-based environments. But
in the mid/long-term the divergences between development and production
environments should be reduced. That means a refinement of these initial
relaxed deployment requirements, allowing the deployment platform on
proper production environment; i.e., an environment without shell
access. But this is part of the natural evolution of any software
product.

4.3 Get started {.c2 .c32 .c21}
---------------

For getting started to work with the Fusepool P3 platform, since all the
core components are not yet deployed to Maven central repositories, the
first thing you would need to actually do is to build the platform from
the source code. For that you previously would need a couple of tools
installed in your machine, such as Git and Maven, as well as a Java 7
Development Toolkit (JDK) configured.

The code is available at the Fusepool P3 organization in
github^[[38]](#ftnt38)^, from where you should clone it:

[](#)[](#)


    git clone --recursive
    https://github.com/fusepoolP3/platform fusepoolp3-platform


Then you just need to execute the integrated bash launcher, which will
take care of building and launching all components that currently
compose the platform:

[](#)[](#)


    \$ ./start.sh

    Building platform from the source code....

    Successfully compiled platform source code

    Starting marmotta backend....

    Marmotta backend started at http://localhost:8080

    Starting stanbol worker....

    Stanbol worker started at http://localhost:8081

    Starting proxy....

    LDP Transformation Proxy started at http://localhost:8181

    Successfully started Fusepool P3 platform!

    total time: 00m 53s

    logs available at target/\*.log


Then you can perform some basic LDP interactions with the platform:

[](#)[](#)


    \$ curl -i -X POST --data-binary @test.txt -H "Content-Type: text/plain"
    \\

The LDP Transformation Proxy would not perform any transformation if
there is no transformer registered in the platform. Please, refer to
Section 2.3 to get a more understanding about such workflows.

In the mid-term, the platform will provide user interfaces for perform
such kind of tasks. The following figure shows the current research and
development from WP4 in that direction.

![fusepool-p3-ldp-screenshot.png](images/image01.png)

Lastly, as defined by the architecture, it is important to remark once
more that the platform does not provide a common runtime for all
components. Therefore all these components are running as independent
processes. in order to make a bit easier the tasks of stopping the whole
platform, another bash script is provided to stop all components
previously started:

[](#)[](#)


    \$ ./stop.sh

    stopping process 18501...

    stopping process 18531...

    stopping process 18513...

    Fusepool P3 platform should be stopped now


As described in the section above, this deployment architecture has to
evolve towards reducing the divergences between development and
production environments. If you want to know further details about the
toolset used, please refer to the tutorials available at the official
web sites of each tool, where they already provide extensive
documentation.

6. Conclusions and future work {.c2 .c21}
==============================

The current document delivers the initial architectural specification
and basic implementation of the Fusepool P3 platform. But we are aware
it is not yet a proper platform specification among the several open
questions the project still has. For example, this first version
triggers the discussion of some core aspects, such as access control.
But there are some others that were not even considered at all at this
stage; for example, the debuggability of the process may be a required
featured by some scenarios, including data staging on each
transformation performed, rollback and provenance. Therefore it is
obvious that all these key parts of the platform can not be properly
specified yet. But as soon as the user cases requirements get more
structured, some of those details will come clearer for upcoming
iterations over this specification.

The main goal was of this document to set the basic pillars where the
complete Fusepool P3 project can be built on top of. This document
accommodates the idea outlined in the proposal to the current status of
the technology. Together this document it is been delivered an open
source implementation, including the basic implementation of some of the
core components described above. All these components have to evolve
together the rest of the project, and moved towards the high-level goal
of providing an integrated data-value chain management platform.

[[26]](#ftnt_ref26) Please, note that VAL is a component of Virtuoso
Commercial Edition only, and it is not part of Virtuoso Open Source
Edition.  If required, OpenLink would allow the Fusepool P3 consortium
to use Virtuoso commercial edition with a time limited license for the
duration of the project; regular licensing will apply when the project
is completed. \
Anyway, this architecture has been designed to allow such commercial
extensions without affecting the overall pipeline. Therefore this
commercial component is just an optional extension, which is not
required to run the open source version of the Fusepool P3 platform.
